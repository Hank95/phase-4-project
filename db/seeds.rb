A 6.2kWh battery pack is good for about 1.5 hours of ride time, with a top speed of 80 MPH and a 0-62 time of 4.5 seconds. Charge time to 85% is about three hours, and ODP-M1 weighs in at only 253 pounds. A USD fork, wave brake rotors, monoshock rear suspension, and spoked wheels. Offset plans to start taking preorders for the off-road OFR-M1, with the ODP-M1 coming shortly after.",

The reduced size doesn't mean Droog skimped on features, as engine choices range from 125cc to 190cc, with a custom intake, exhaust, and digital fuel injection. This makes for a top speed of at least 65 mph, with all engine parameters available in a compact digital instrument cluster. Styling takes Droog's unique vision and downscales it perfectly for the platform, with trademark cues like solid wheels and scrambler tires present. Each DM-018 is built to order with nearly any option on the table that the customer can think up. The final price will be determined by the upgrades and changes the customer selects; all modifications and upgrades are available post-purchase as each bike is built in collaboration with Droog.",
